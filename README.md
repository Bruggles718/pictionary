# Pictionary

## Why Pictionary?
I wanted to learn about web sockets with node js, and I decided this would be a fun project that would help me do that.

## How to run:
Currently, I am hosting this at http://pictionary.ddnsfree.com, but if you'd like to run it yourself, you can do so as follows:
* install node js
* navigate to this directory in a terminal, and use `npm install` to install all the necessary packages
* then use `npm start` to build and run the project
* open the browser, and navigate to https://localhost:3000
